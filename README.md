Option Discovery

From Weiwei Zhang (260 684 686)

In this assignment I read and compared several approaches of automatic options discovery. Considering it is the key and first step of the Temporal Abstraction task, instead of focusing on one paper, I was trying to survey four of the most popular methods, which are the method of using diverse density from McGovern and Barto, Q-Cut from Menache et al., the method based on betweenness from Simsek and Barto and the method based on Spatio-Temporal Clustering from  Lakshminarayanan et al.
